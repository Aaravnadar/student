    "## 1) Start of they Year\n",
    "At the start of the year I knew how to write some small basic little code, but working inside a full repository with notebooks, build scripts, and a Makefile was all brand new to me. At the start I was just goofing off with my friends and then I acted all surprised when I didn't know what was going on.\n",
    "Eventually I realized that to succeed, all you have to do is pay attention in class. Since the beginning of the year I have learned to actually pay attention in class and it has made a major difference. I actually understand what our team is doing and I can collaborate with them a LOT better. One of the biggest things and most turning points in this class was when I built a small little snake game in class with my classmate’s help—for once I felt like a really good coder and it boosted my confidence. In the future, next tri, for CSSE and other classes, I am going to try my hardest to simply pay attention because I have seen results from that. I can say with certainty that I see 2 completely different people.\n",

    "## 2) Key takeaways from our sprints\n",
    "\n",
    "From the sprints I learned about classes, variables, and the terminal. In classes, I remember that it acts as a blueprint where you can store variables. Variables are a storage for something that you want to keep. The ubuntu terminal is a place we installed on our computers to type code to open the vs code.\n",

    "## 3) How N@tM went? Did you get a comment or two you liked?\n",
    "\n",
    "Night @ the Museum was a fantastic, though slightly chaotic, experience! Our presentation went pretty smoothly, and it was rewarding to see people actually using the product we had spent so much time on. The biggest success was having our project fully deployed and operational for the public to interact with.\n",
    "I did get a couple of comments that I really liked. One person specifically mentioned that the navigation was clear and they enjoyed the creative CSS styling we used, which was something I spent a lot of time on. Another person, a parent, commented on how much they appreciated that our project was educational and engaging for students, which made the whole effort feel worthwhile. It was a huge confidence booster to receive positive feedback from people outside of our immediate class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) What do you want to do next on project, given time? \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had to time to have another project I would probably revise the project we just did and make it better, I didn't really like the way we did this project, I would much rather prefer if we took our 3 people groups and we made our own games that we want to make. However this past project has been so much fun and I guess that since we collaborated with the ENTIRE class it was a lot easier to design a much better desing than we could have if it was just our 3 people groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) What do you want to learn next in CompSci?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing I want to learn in computer science is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how it is made. Specifically, I want to learn the fundamentals of Python and how it is used to create artificial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Analytics review\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewing our project analytics was eye-opening. The most interesting discovery was seeing the drop-off rate on certain pages of our blog and quiz sections. We found that users would often leave after the initial introductory page. This showed us that even if the code works, the content needs to be compelling and structured to immediately hook the user. We also saw that the time spent on our gamification page was significantly higher than on informational pages, confirming that interactive elements are key to engagement. This review confirmed the importance of using data to guide future design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Something cool, you want to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something cool that I would like to tell is about Night @ the Museum, before the event occured I was still stressed that maybe something wouldn't work out, our game would glitch, we would ruin everyones work. However, our team broke through and our game was amazing. We got good reviews from people and they loved it. It was so much fun, after such a long time of work, to finally see our finished product displayed for everyone to see, however, in computer science, we are never done with our work.\n",
