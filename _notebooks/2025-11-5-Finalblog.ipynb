    "### 1) Start of the year\n",
    "At the start of the year I knew how to write some small basic little code, but working inside a full repository with notebooks, build scripts, and a Makefile was all brand new to me. At the start I was just goofing off with my friends and then I acted all surprised when I didn't know what was going on.\n",
    "Eventually I realized that to succeed, all you have to do is pay attention in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) What I can do now\n",
    "Since the beginning of the year I have learned to actually pay attention in class and it has made a major difference, I actually understand what our team is doing and I can collaborate with them a LOT better. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Concrete wins\n",
    " One of the biggest things and most turning points in this class was when I built a small little snake game in class with my classmate's help for once I felt like a really good coder and it boosted my confidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) What’s next\n",
    "In the future, next tri, for CSSE and other classes, I am going to try my hardest to simply pay attention because I have seen results from that. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Personal note\n",
    "The biggest difference is confidence. When comparing myself from the start of the year to now I can say with cetainty that I see 2 completely different people. \n"
