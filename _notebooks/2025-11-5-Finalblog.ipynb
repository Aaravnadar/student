    "## My Growth: Then vs. Now (2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Where I started\n",
    "At the start of the year I knew how to write basic code, but working inside a full repository with notebooks, build scripts, and a Makefile felt messy. I struggled with:\n",
    "- Getting dependencies installed and using virtual environments.\n",
    "- Debugging Python npm/JS module errors.\n",
    "- Understanding how notebook conversions (nbconvert) and the Makefile interacted with the site build.\n",
    "- Committing clean, meaningful git changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) What I can do now\n",
    "Over the year I learned concrete, practical skills:\n",
    "- Environment and dependency management: I create virtual environments, install packages locally, and troubleshoot ModuleNotFoundError issues (for example installing `nbconvert` and `progress`).\n",
    "- Build troubleshooting: I can read `make` errors, identify missing directories or packages, and either create missing folders or update the Makefile steps.\n",
    "- JavaScript + Notebook work: I can write interactive `%%html` cells, add DOM elements, and wire up event listeners for small assignments (Popcorn hacks, homework functions).\n",
    "- Git basics: I stage changes, write commit messages, and push to the remote repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Concrete wins\n",
    "- Fixed a notebook conversion error by installing `nbconvert` in the virtual environment and creating missing `_notebooks/CSP` directories when needed.\n",
    "- Implemented and debugged multiple JS homework tasks: math functions, conditional hacks, array utilities.\n",
    "- Built a small CookieClicker class with upgrades — learned how to structure classes and test usage in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) What’s next\n",
    "- Add a `requirements.txt` or pinned environment file for reproducibility.\n",
    "- Refactor the Makefile to skip non-existent folders or make the script robust to missing notebooks.\n",
    "- Write at least one polished notebook blog post showing a project from idea → code → notes (and publish it).\n",
    "- Start writing small tests or assertions for notebook outputs so grading/review is faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Personal note\n",
    "The biggest difference is confidence: I know where to look when things break, how to search/diagnose, and how to take small steps until the build is green. That’s a change that makes learning new features much faster.\n"
