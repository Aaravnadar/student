### Create a Cookie Clicker Game
- Add 1 point every time the user clicks on the "cookie" or whatever icon you choose

> 90% Hack: add sound effects to the "cookie" when you click it

> 100% Hack: add a shop to buy workers to increase cookie count passively. You can take a look at the [original project](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) to see how the shop works.
