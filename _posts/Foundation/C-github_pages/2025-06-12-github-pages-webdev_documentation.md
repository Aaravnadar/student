## Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Pages Repository

1. Create a new repository cloned from template (idk which repo).
2. Clone it locally and open it in VS Code.
3. Ensure you have the necessary files:
   - `_config.yml`
   - `index.md`
   - `_posts/` folder

## Step 2: Customize `index.md`

- [Visual Studio Code](/tools/vscode)
``` 

### Example (HTML Buttons):

```html
<h2>Developer Toolkit</h2>
<a href="/tools/github"><button>GitHub</button></a>

```

git push origin main
```
### 2. Configure GitHub Pages

In your GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Branch**: Select `main` from dropdown
   - **Folder**: Select `/(root)`
3. Click **Save**

### 3. Verify Deployment

- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete
- Refresh the page to see the active deployment status
- A green checkmark will appear when deployment succeeds

### 4. Access Your Site

Your site will be live at:

https://<username>.github.io/<repository>
