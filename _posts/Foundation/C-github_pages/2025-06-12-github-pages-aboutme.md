##  Overview

In this tutorial, you will:
- Set up and deploy your personal site using GitHub Pages
- Create an **About Me** page with Markdown
- Add a **Tools Hub** page that links to your Day 1 lessons
- Learn to test on `localhost`, commit with Git, and view on `github.io`

This becomes your **hub** for your development journey.

##  Step 1: Edit `_config.yml`

Your `_config.yml` file is the settings file that powers your Jekyll site.

### Sample `_config.yml`

```yaml
title: Open Coding 
description: "Class of 2026"
owner_name: John Mortensen
github_username: jm1021 
github_repo: "stodent" 
baseurl: "/student" 
future: true
remote_theme: jekyll/minima
minima:
  skin: dark
  social_links:
    - { platform: github, user_url: "https://github.com/open-coding-society" }
    - { platform: x, user_url: "https://x.com/Open_Coding" }
    - { platform: youtube, user_url: "https://www.youtube.com/@OpenCodingSociety" } 
plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
  - jekyll-include-cache
header_pages:
  - navigation/blog.md
  - navigation/search.md
  - navigation/about.md
  - navigation/logintoolkit.md
```

### Customize These Fields

- **title**: Change to your name or site theme  
- **description**: Write a brief tagline or site purpose  
- **owner_name**: Your full name  
- **github_username** and **github_repo**: Match your GitHub  
- **baseurl**: Should be `"/your_repo_name"` (include the slash)

## Step 2: Edit `about.md`

In the `navigation/` folder, edit `about.md` with content personalized to you:

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: "About Me"
permalink: /about/
---

---
layout: page

permalink: /tools/
---

# Tools Hub

Welcome to my tools hub! Here are links to my key setup guides and lessons:

## Step 4: Commit & Sync Your Changes

Once everythingâ€™s in place, you need to **commit** your changes and **sync** them to GitHub using VSCode.

### In VSCode:
1. Open the **Source Control** tab (ðŸ”ƒ icon on the left).
2. Stage all changes.
3. Write a commit message (e.g., `initial setup`), then click âœ” **Commit**.
4. Click the **Sync Changes** button to push your commit to GitHub.

You can also run:

```bash
make 
```
to test the site locally.
