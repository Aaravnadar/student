# Linux and Cybersecurity Basics

Welcome to your first comprehensive lesson on **Linux fundamentals and cybersecurity awareness**! This module introduces you to working in a Linux environment, understanding essential terminal commands, managing file systems and permissions, and recognizing common security vulnerabilities that occur in real-world deployments.

## Linux Navigation and Command Line Skills

### Navigating the Filesystem

Understanding the file system hierarchy in Linux is crucial. Some of the most common directories include:

* `/home` – user directories
* `/etc` – system configuration files
* `/var` – logs and variable data
* `/bin` and `/usr/bin` – essential system commands

Essential navigation commands:

* `pwd` – Display the current directory
* `ls` – List files and directories
* `cd` – Change directory

> **Try it:**
>
> ```bash
> pwd
> ls
> cd /etc
> ```

### Creating and Modifying Files

Creating and editing files from the command line is a daily skill in Linux.

* `touch filename` – Create a new empty file
* `nano filename` – Open a file in a text editor within the terminal
* `cat filename` – Display file contents

> **Try it:**
>
> ```bash
> touch welcome.txt
> nano welcome.txt
> cat welcome.txt
> ```

You can also redirect output into files:

```bash
echo "Hello, Linux" > message.txt
```

### Permissions and Superuser Access

Linux permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file. Each file has three permission sets:

* **Owner**
* **Group**
* **Others**

Permission symbols:

* `r` = read
* `w` = write
* `x` = execute

Key commands:

* `chmod` – Change permissions
* `chown` – Change file ownership
* `sudo` – Execute commands as a superuser

> **Try it:**
>
> ```bash
> ls -l
> chmod 755 welcome.txt
> sudo chown root:root welcome.txt
> ```

## Basic Cybersecurity Awareness

Understanding Linux also means being aware of how misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.

### No SSL (Insecure Web Services)

When web services use HTTP instead of HTTPS, all communication is unencrypted and can be intercepted. Developers should:

* Always use HTTPS in production.
* Install SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt or similar tools.

### Default Credentials

Devices and software often ship with default usernames and passwords such as:

* `admin:admin`
* `root:toor`

Best practice:

* Always change default credentials after setup.
* Disable unused accounts.

### Open Ports

Open ports allow services to communicate over a network. Attackers often scan for open ports to find vulnerabilities.

Check open ports:

```bash
netstat -tuln
ss -tuln
```

Use firewalls (like `ufw`) to limit exposure:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw deny 80
```

### Open or Unrestricted File Permissions

Files with permissions like `777` are a major security risk. They allow anyone to read, write, and execute the file.

### Exposed Personal Data and APIs

Never store API tokens, secrets, or passwords in:

* Public folders (e.g., `/var/www/html`)
* Git repositories
* Files like `config.json` without access control

Use environment variables and secure vaults instead.

## Summary Checklist

| Area                | What You Should Know                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filesystem          | Navigate with `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`; understand Linux directory structure   |
| File Operations     | Use `touch`, `nano`, `cat`, and `echo` to manage files                  |
| Permissions         | Understand `chmod`, `chown`, and how Linux file modes affect access     |
| Superuser           | Use `sudo` carefully to gain elevated privileges                        |
| SSL and HTTP        | Avoid transmitting sensitive info over HTTP                             |
| Default Credentials | Change them and audit system users                                      |
| Open Ports          | Use `netstat`/`ss` to find ports; limit access with `ufw` or `iptables` |
| Exposed Data        | Never hardcode secrets or leave tokens in public directories            |

## Guided Practice Exercise

Try these steps in your terminal or sandbox environment:

1. Create a directory named `myproject` inside your home folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/myproject
   ```
2. Navigate to that folder and create a file called `notes.txt`:

   ```bash
   cd ~/myproject
   touch notes.txt
   ```
3. Open and edit the file using `nano`, then view it using `cat`.
4. Check its permissions with `ls -l`, and make it read-only for others:

   ```bash
   chmod 744 notes.txt
   ```
5. Check which ports are open on your system:

   ```bash
   ss -tuln
   ```
6. Use `sudo` to list files in `/root` (if allowed):

   ```bash
   sudo ls /root
   ```
